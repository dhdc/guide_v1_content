<h3 id="what">What is this?</h3>

The DH Curation Guide is a compilation of articles that address aspects
of data curation in the digital humanities. The goal of the DH Curation
Guide is to direct readers to trusted resources with enough context from
expert editors and the other members of the research community to
indicate to how these resources might help them with their own data
curation challenges.

Each article provides a short introduction to a topic and a list of
linked resources. Structuring articles in this way acknowledges the many
excellent resources that already exist to provide guidance on subjects
relevant to curation such as data formats, legal policies, description,
and more.

Want to know more about what data curation is? Head to the [FAQ about
data curation](../faq/).

<h3 id="who">Who wrote the articles?</h3>

An initial set of articles have been penned by contributing editors who
are authorities in their fields. You can read more about them on the
[contributing editors page](../editors). Every article has been
submitted to a rigorous editing process guided by managing editors
[Trevor Muñoz](../editors/index.html#trevormunoz) and [Julia
Flanders](../editors/index.html#juliaflanders). This process ensures
that the article presents accurate, up-to-date information and adheres
to the Guide's purpose, tone, and style.

<h3 id="how">How can I contribute?</h3>

**As a reader:** The community is strongly encouraged to add other
resources (like journal articles, standards explanations, case studies,
etc.) and contribute their own remarks on the content of the articles
through the commenting system. Contributions deemed especially helpful
by the contributing editors will be incorporated into the body of the
article with credit to the contributing user. Data curation is a rapidly
growing, changing field, and the Guide needs constant community-driven
updates to remain a useful, living document.

**As an editor:** At the beta stage of the project, not every topic has
been taken up by an editor. We encourage knowledgable community members
to become contributing editors by writing articles (introductions and
resource lists) for topics not yet covered, such as Metadata, Digital
Preservation, other Research Areas, and other Repository Systems. These
are important knowledge areas and the community benefits from having a
starting point within the context of the Guide. A helpful contribution
can be as short as a paragraph or two or as substantial as an entire
article. All contributions are subject to a thorough editing process. If
you would like to contribute an article in whole or in part, please
<a href="mailto:dhcuration@gmail.com">email the managing
editors</a>.

<h3 id="history">Project history</h3>

The DH Curation Guide grew out of a needs analysis study of data
curation at digital humanities centers conducted by the [Data Curation
Education Program for the Humanities
(DCEP-H)](http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/CollMeta/dcep.html) at the
Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS), University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, which has been generously funded by a
grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services
(RE-05-08-0062-08). In the course of interviewing directors and
senior-level staff of centers engaged in digital research in the
humanities, project team members identified a clear need for a
collection of reviewed, trusted resources for basic information on
issues related to data curation. The DH Curation Guide is an initial
contribution toward meeting that need.

Coordinated by the [Center for Informatics Research in Science and
Scholarship (CIRSS)](http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/index.html), the
DCEP-H program extends the existing Data Curation specialization within
the ALA-accredited master's program at GSLIS to include humanities data.
Encompassing curriculum design, internships, a fellowship program as
well as other activities in addition to the needs analysis survey,
DCEP-H is intended to prepare information professionals for the unique
challenges of working with humanities research data.

<h3 id="technical">Technical notes</h3>

The DH Curation Guide is hosted by the Center for Informatics Research
in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS) within the Graduate School of Library
and Information Science (GSLIS) at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. The Guide is currently a research project under active
development. Things may not display or behave as intended. We would
appreciate any feedback sent to
<a href="mailto:dhcuration@gmail.com">dhcuration [at] gmail.com</a>.

**Article encoding:** Each full-length article is encoded in a custom
XML schema. The XML is transformed via an XSLT stylesheet into uniform
HTML. The resulting web pages are styled by a single CSS document.

**Comments:** The commenting system is a custom implementation
programmed in-house at CIRSS by Jamie Little. Most other commenting
systems on the web follow a "1 document: 1 comment thread" model. In
most cases, this is sufficient. But the Guide's articles are complexly
structured, and readers benefit from comments that behave like
annotations on specific parts of the article. This design was partly
inspired by the work of [Media Commons
Press](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mcpress/) but evolved to
meet the needs of this site and the project team's publishing workflow.

The main aspects of our licensing policy are as follows:

We strongly encourage all forms of **educational, academic, and
