What is data curation?

We define data curation as the active and on-going management of data
through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarly and
educational activities across the sciences, social sciences, and the
humanities [(Cragin et al.
2007)](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/3493). Data curation
activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain data quality,
add value, and provide for re-use over time. This new field includes
representation, archiving, authentication, management, preservation,
retrieval, and use. See the [Introduction to Humanities Data
Curation](../intro) article for more detail.

Whose responsibility is data curation?

Responsibility for data curation rests, in different ways, on a number
of different professional roles. Increasingly, within the library, data
curation responsibilities are being associated with specific jobs (with
titles like “data curator” or “data curation specialist”), and the rise
of specialized training programs within library schools has reinforced
this process by providing a stream of qualified staff to fill these
roles. At the same time, other kinds of library staff have
responsibilities that may dovetail with (or even take the place of)
these specific roles: for instance, metadata librarians are strongly
engaged in curatorial processes, as are repository managers and subject
librarians who work closely with data creators in specific fields.
Finally, it is increasingly being recognized that the data creators
themselves (faculty researchers or library staff) have a very important
responsibility at the outset: to follow relevant standards, to document
their work and methods, and to work closely with data curation
specialists so that their data is curatable over the long term.

Where does data curation fit into the data creation process?

Data curation and data creation are closely linked. It is now
commonplace to observe that data curation starts with the data creation
process. But even if we distinguish these processes, the sooner data
curation starts the more effectively it can operate to ensure that data
creation processes are carefully documented and that appropriate
standards and best practices are followed.

How is data curation different from data storage?

Data storage is confined to simply keeping data in existence and
ensuring that it can be accessed when needed. It does not necessarily
entail practices of refreshment or format migration (essential to
maintaining the data in a usable form) nor does it entail higher-level
curatorial practices such as enhancement of the data through added
metadata, or migration from one representational standard to another.
Data curation thus goes far beyond the scope of data storage.

Are data curation practices subject-specific?

Yes, they often are, although some data curation practices may apply
very broadly (for instance, the creation and enhancement of metadata).
Subject-specific practices might include migrating data from one
standard to another (which might require detailed knowledge of
subject-specific methods of data representation or familiarity with a
subject-specific schema), or the creation of subject-specific metadata,
such as topical keywords or identification of named entities.

Where, institutionally, should data curation be managed?

The institutional library is often a natural place for data curation
activities, especially if the library is also responsible for curatorial
infrastructure such as an institutional repository. The library also
often serves as a hub that connects with all departments, which would
help ensure consistency of data curation practices across the
institution. However, in many institutions the IT organization may also
have a crucial role to play, either as the chief entity responsible for
managing data curation, or as a partner with the library.

What data and file formats pose greatest challenges for data curation?

Proprietary data and file formats pose significant challenges for data
curation simply because they may not remain current, and the tools and
software necessary to work with these formats may become inaccessible
(for reasons of cost or obsolescence). Any data or file format that
undergoes repeated, substantive changes is also challenging because data
submitted over time is likely to vary, and will probably require
frequent updating to maintain currency and consistency.
