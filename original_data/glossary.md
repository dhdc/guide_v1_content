## C

## D

[Data curation](#datacuration)

The active and on-going management of data through its lifecycle of
interest and usefulness to scholarly and educational activities across
the sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. Data curation
activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain data quality,
add value, and provide for re-use over time. This new field includes
representation, archiving, authentication, management, preservation,
retrieval, and use. See the [introduction](intro/) for more detail.

Data format

A specific convention for data representation: i.e. the way that
information is encoded and stored for use in a computer system, possibly
constrained by a formal data type or set of standards.

[Digital object identifier, DOI](#doi)

A permanent identifier associated with a digital object that permits it
to be referenced reliably even if its location and metadata undergo
change over time.

[[back to top]](#top)

## E

[EAD](#ead)

The [Encoded Archival Description](http://www.loc.gov/ead/), a metadata
standard for representing archival finding aids in digital form.

[[back to top]](#top)

## F

[Fedora](#fedora)

An open-source digital repository system.

The Institute for Museum and Library Services, a US federal funding
agency focusing on programs and research in museum and library science.

The [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://www.ietf.org), a standards
organization focused on the development of the standards that underlie
the overall operation of the Internet.

ISO

The [International Organization for
Standardization](http://www.iso.org), the largest standardization
organization today.

## J

[JTC](#jct)

(abbrev.) Joint Technical Committee

[[back to top]](#top)

## K

[[back to top]](#top)

## L

[[back to top]](#top)

## M

[METS](#mets)

The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard, an XML language for
representing metadata to describe the structure, content, and management
of digital objects within a digital library or digital repository.

[MODS](#mods)

The Metadata Object Description Schema, a specification for representing
bibliographic data in digital form.

[[back to top]](#top)

## N

[Natural language processing, NLP](#nlp)

A research domain concerned with the automated processing and
recognition of human (i.e. natural rather than machine) language.

[NEH](#neh)

The [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov), a US
federal funding agency focused on supporting research and education in
the humanities.

[NISO](#niso)

The [National Information Standards Organization](http://www.niso.org),
a member-based standards organization that has been accredited by
[ANSI](#ansi).

[NSF](#nsf)

The [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov), a US federal
funding agency focused on supporting research and education in the
sciences.

## O

[OAI-PMH](#oai)

The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, a
protocol for collecting metadata records from participating archives,
who expose their metadata in a standard format.

[OCR, optical character recognition](#ocr)

An automated process of transforming image data into text data by
identifying shapes and mapping them onto alphanumeric characters. OCR
technology is commonly used as an early step in the digitization
process, to produce searchable text from digitized page images.

[Ontology](#ontology)

A formal representation of a system of knowledge as a set of explicitly
defined concepts and relationships between them. In digital form,
ontologies are used as a way of providing a public, shared semantics for
the key concepts being used for research or analysis.

## P

[Provenance](#provenance)

Information about the origin, location, and ownership history of an
object or resource.

[[back to top]](#top)

## Q

[[back to top]](#top)

## R

Resources

In the context of the web, resources are addressable units of
information (addressed through Uniform Resource Identifiers or URIs).

[[back to top]](#top)

## S

[SDO](#SDO)

Standards Developing Organizations, a term often used for formal
standards organizations, such as ISO.

[Service-oriented architecture, SOA](#soa)

An approach to software engineering in which applications are designed
as sets of interoperable, reusable services that communicate through
clearly defined interfaces and protocols, rather than as monolithic
systems.

Stack, software stack, technology stack

A set of software components designed as separable layers, each one
handling a distinct set of characteristic functions and interacting with
its adjacent layers through a set of standard inputs and outputs. By
extension, in phrases like "the XML stack" or "the publication stack",
the term is used more informally to describe a layered set of components
in which data flows "upward" through successive stages of processing,
each of which passes its output on to the next stage in a specified way.
Ideally, the components in a stack are cleanly separable so that
individual components may be replaced with functionally equivalent
pieces (taking the same kind of input and delivering the same kind of
output) without requiring alteration of the rest of the stack.

## T

[TEI, TEI P5](#TEI)

The [Text Encoding Initiative Consortium](http://www.tei-c.org), an
international community standard that develops and maintains the [TEI
Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index-toc.html).
The TEI Guidelines are a markup language for representing humanities
textual data in digital form, expressed as [XML](#xml). The P5 version,
released in 2007, is the current version of the Guidelines.

## U

[Unicode](#unicode)

An international character encoding standard, fully synchronized with
the ISO standard ISO/IEC 10646.

[[back to top]](#top)

## V

[Versioning, version control](#version)

A formal representation of the sequence of changes within a digital
file; a system for tracking and managing such changes explicitly so as
to avoid accidentally replacing a current file with an obsolete previous
version, and so as to permit comparison of different versions, reversion
to an earlier state of the file, and similar actions.

[Virtual research environment, VRE](#vre)

A formal representation of the sequence of changes within a digital
file; a system for tracking and managing such changes explicitly so as
to avoid accidentally replacing a current file with an obsolete previous
version, and so as to permit comparison of different versions, reversion
to an earlier state of the file, and similar actions.
