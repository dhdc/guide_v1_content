[What is data curation?](#introduction)

-   [](#) Add section comment

At present, there are a number of competing terms used to describe the
activity of managing digital materials for research: digital curation,
digital stewardship, data curation, digital archiving. There is overlap
among these definitions or visions. The variation that does exist is due
to more than confusion or carelessness. Each of these terms has
significant connotations and attempts to align the relatively new
activity of caring for digital materials with an older tradition,
discipline, or profession.

[¶ 1](#p001 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

The term and the idea of "curation" is experiencing a moment of cultural
cachet that simultaneously threatens to empty it of meaning.
Nonetheless, curation is a strong and suitably-encompassing term for the
practices we want to describe. When we speak of "curation", what set of
activities do we have in mind? Etymological guidance from the word's
root meaning and early usage gives us the idea of curation as healing,
and of the curator as one who "has the care or charge of a person or
thing", a "guardian" (OED). As the word has emerged in the contexts of
museums and also rare book and manuscript librarianship, "curation" also
carries this dual emphasis: on protection, but also on amelioration,
contextualization, and effective exposure to an appropriate set of
users.

[¶ 2](#p002 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

Digital curation: the curation of digital objects and information might
be straightforwardly derived from curation as described above, but "data
curation" shifts the emphasis and brings an additional consideration
into play. The curation of research data - raw and abstracted material
created as part of research processes and which may be used again as the
input to further research - carries with it the burden of capturing and
preserving not only the data itself, but information about the methods
by which it was produced. If the methods used to generate the data are
[algorithmic](../glossary.html#algorithm), the method itself may need to
be captured and curated. Because these methods and information on the
goals involved in creating the data are often essential to its
subsequent interpretation and reuse, they can be considered an important
part of the data itself. In addition, because reuse is such a crucial
aim, successfully curated data needs to remain functional, and this may
require regular changes to its state. At the current time, a key aspect
of humanities data curation is thus to ensure that the representations
of objects of study in the humanities function effectively as data: that
they are processable by machines and interoperable such that they are
durably processable across systems and collections while still retaining
[provenance](../glossary.html#provenance) and complex layers of meaning.

[¶ 3](#p003 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

As a compact and provisional definition, we might therefore start by
saying that data curation is "the active and ongoing management of data
throughout its entire lifecycle of interest and usefulness to
scholarship" [(Cragin et al. 2007)](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/3493). To
expand on this definition, it may be helpful to gloss some of these
terms in more detail:

-   active and ongoing management: Data curators intervene in the
    research process in order to translate or migrate data into new
    formats, to enhance it through additional layers of context or
    markup, to create connections between data sets, and to otherwise
    ensure that data is maintained in as highly-functional a form as
    possible.
-   entire lifecycle: As we enter the era of thoroughly digital
    research, the full lifecycle of digital research data is still not
    yet known to us. However, we can anticipate that some data
    (particularly data collected through destructive means, such as
    archaeological data) will have a very long horizon of usefulness (in
    addition to increased evidentiary value for historical analysis and
    stewardship of our cultural heritage). The uses of data will likely
    change over time and with different stages of research.
-   interest and usefulness to scholarship: The term "scholarship"
    should be construed broadly, especially since data creation, use,
    and curation are not limited to the academy. Data curation seeks to
    retain the interest and usefulness of any data that has a serious
    purpose to fulfill. Furthermore, even for data created and curated
    within the academy, it is worth remarking that there may be
    potential user communities outside the academy that could provide
    valuable motivation and even resources for the curation process.
    Especially given the recent and increasing emphasis on
    crowd-sourcing, community-driven data, and the permeability of the
    boundary between the academy and the public sphere, it is reasonable
    to anticipate that definitions of "scholarship" may continue to
    broaden rather than narrow over time.

[¶ 4](#p004 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

Data curation is, as Terry Cook has written of archives, both a
scholarly research area and a praxis and, increasingly, data curation
too uses a distinct methodology to advance itself as both a discipline
and a profession [(in Gilliland-Swetland
2000)](http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html).
Understanding data curation in this dual context means recognizing the
range of different kinds of training and expertise upon which it draws,
including:

-   expertise in humanities subject disciplines
-   expertise in library and information science
-   expertise in archival science
-   expertise in computer science
-   expertise in systems/records management

Understanding data curation in a practical context also means knowing
how curation intersects with a number of specific actions and processes,
including:

-   description: Documentation of the context of data and the
    relationships between different forms and functions of research data
    and its analysis.
-   annotation: Annotation includes a number of activities that add
    further information to the data, either in the form of additional
    markup that identifies data structures at a finer level of detail,
    or in the form of added information that contextualizes or glosses
    parts of the content (such as the identification of named entities).
-   collection/aggregation: Collection refers to the creation of meaning
    through connecting functions of institutions, projects, or teams to
    the data they create, or also to the role of some subset of data to
    a larger information ecosystem.
-   storage: Storage here stands in for a number of activities related
    to the encoding of data to physical media and the provisioning and
    maintainence of concrete systems that underly stability and basic
    accessibility of data.
-   migration: Because of constant changes to data formats and data
    representation standards, long-term data curation necessitates
    regular migration of data to keep it in formats that can be read and
    used. Although strategies exist (such as emulation or preservation
    of original hardware and systems) that permit data to be used in its
    original form, migration has additional value in allowing data
    formats to be harmonized, so as to permit more effective usage
    across data sets.

[Unique Features of Humanities Data Curation](#unique_features)

-   [](#) Add section comment

In extending our understanding of data curation from the sciences to the
humanities, one of the significant challenges is the specific forms of
data the humanities disciplines present. By this we do not mean simply
data types, although it is worth noting at the outset that humanities
data includes (potentially) almost any data type. But in addition,
humanities data is presented in specialized aggregations that themselves
have significance for understanding, using, and curating the data. Some
of these aggregations are digital extensions of long-standing
traditional forms: for instance, finding aids, concordances, and
scholarly editions, which have a long analog history. Others, like the
thematic research collection or digital text corpus, are products of new
digital research methods (though they also respond to
discipline-specific research needs with a pre-digital history).

[¶ 14](#p006 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

Although the field of humanities data is growing steadily, at present we
can identify several major types of research objects and collections
that present distinctive forms of data and distinctive curation
challenges.

-   Scholarly editions: Again, a high degree of formal structure but
    with very substantial variability, arising both from disciplinary
    differences (e.g. documentary editing vs. critical editing vs.
    genetic editing) and from smaller variances of practice to handle
    the exigencies of individual cases. Issue of whether there's any
    possibility of cross-edition synthesis: do curators treat each
    edition as a distinct entity? Also, because each edition reflects
    individual editorial perspectives and expertise to such a degree,
    effective curation requires highly specialized knowledge. A
    community of editorial practice has arisen around the use of the TEI
    Guidelines, which supports the use of systematic encoding of
    information about individual witnesses, variant readings, and
    editorial process. However, digital scholarly editions may also be
    constituted as collections of page images with metadata and
    annotations (which may or may not themselves contain usefully
    structured information), or (less rigorously) as web pages
    representing the text and apparatus of the edition. In cases of the
    latter kind, the scholarship represented in the content and editing
    of the text may be of a very high order, even though the digital
    representation does not use comparably rigorous methods, and in
    these cases the task of the curator may be to migrate the edition
    into more robust and maintainable formats.
-   Text corpora: Because they are among the earliest applications of
    digital technology to humanities research, text corpora have a long
    history which also reflects the use of a variety of standards and
    digitization approaches. The corpus may contain internal markup
    representing linguistic, grammatical, vocal, or semantic categories,
    and will probably also contain metadata (at the corpus and record
    level) documenting the principles of corpus construction (e.g.
    sampling and segmentation methods, normalization) and also the
    relevant facts about each item in it (e.g. demographic details about
    speakers, bibliographic information about sources). From a curation
    standpoint, it may be desirable to harmonize corpus metadata to
    permit cross-corpus analysis.
-   Text with markup: Structured text, and especially documents in which
    XML markup has been used to represent document structure and
    content, is becoming an increasingly important part of digital
    humanities research. In the simplest cases, the markup is confined
    to simple metadata, but XML languages (especially those like TEI
    which are intended for scholarly use) are becoming more widely used
    to represent the details of document structure, editorial
    annotations, and also aspects of content such as named entities,
    intertextual references, and thematic or interpretive information.
    Marked-up text presents some special features of relevance to the
    data curator, since the markup typically reflects (explicitly or
    implicitly) a specific editorial frame of reference that itself may
    be of importance for subsequent re-use of the data. They also
    present challenges because of the wide variation in how particular
    markup schemes are applied.
-   Thematic research collections: where text data, images, and
    contextual information are bound together in highly structured ways.
    Such collections can be treated, for some purposes, as a simple
    aggregation of individual assets (XML files, image files, etc.) but
    the organization of the collection and the editorial logic that is
    represented in ancillary materials such as stylesheets and
    configuration files is likely to be extremely significant, not only
    in making sense of the collection but also in recovering the
    editorial intentions and decisions that constitute it as
    scholarship.
-   Data with accompanying analysis or annotation: In many cases,
    humanities data takes the form of a "primary" digital object (such
    as an image, a map, a virtual 3-D reconstruction) which has been
    enhanced with annotations or analysis. Annotations may be associated
    with specific regions of the object, either taking advantage of
    specific anchors in the data, such as ID values on XML elements, or
    using external pointing schemes such as the identification of
    regions within an image by offsets from the origin. In either case
    the association may be vulnerable to disruption if the target file
    changes. In this category we can also include scholarly editions
    that consist of a text annotated with variant readings, emendations,
    and other editorial information. With data of this kind, it may be
    useful to consider the "primary" object as having research value
    that extends beyond the original intentions of the creator, and
    apart from the annotations and analysis that express those
    intentions.
-   Finding aids and other information maps, such as bibliographies:
    high degree of formal structure; strongly codified by history of
    practice, but starting to evolve in light of digital affordances,
    leading to discrepancies (e.g. between EAD records created from
    traditional finding aids and those "born digital") that may need to
    be remedied in the interest of long-term function.

[¶ 15](#p007 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

In addition to these distinctive kinds of humanities data, there are
also a few strategic points concerning the treatment of this data that
need to be stressed:

-   The importance of interpretive layering: While data in
    non-humanities disciplines clearly carries an interpretive framework
    with it, in the humanities the interpretation is in some cases the
    primary object of interest, not just a perspective on the data that
    can be separated from it. For instance, in a digital edition, the
    source document on its own may be of comparatively little importance
    (being readily available from other sources) but the compilation of
    variant readings, emendations, and commentary make the edition
    distinctively valuable. Similarly, a thematic research collection
    whose texts are encoded in TEI/XML may include layers of
    interpretive information: in the markup itself (for instance, in the
    way that genre is characterized, or in the identification of
    narrative turns), in the metadata (which may carry details of
    editorial principles), in the annotations and commentary, in the
    stylesheets that determine how the collection appears to a user and
    which textual possibilities are expressed or suppressed, and in the
    interface design (expressed in programming or configuration files)
    that opens up or forecloses specific usage options.
-   The importance of information about how the data is captured and
    prepared: This information is also crucial to curation of data in
    the sciences. In the humanities, the details are quite different and
    the significance of some operations may not be as obvious. Crucial
    decisions affecting the usability and meaning of humanities data are
    made at each stage of data creation and management, and the
    documentation concerning these decisions is likely to be valuable to
    both future users and curators of the data. These decisions may
    include the choice of source (the edition or in some cases the
    specific copy that serves as the basis for the digital object), the
    calibration of instrumentation (including color balancing, lighting,
    camera settings, sampling rates), the method of data capture (such
    as OCR, double-keying, etc.), the details of transcription
    (including regularization, handling of illegibility and uncertainty,
    handling of special characters), the details of the encoding scheme
    used (including whatever extensions or customizations have been made
    to it), the level and type of quality assurance testing and error
    correction, the kinds of editorial oversight that have been
    exercised, and the details of any subsequent curatorial activity.
-   The importance of capturing responsibility, editorial voice, and
    debate: As noted briefly above, in humanities data the interpretive
    layers that accompany and contextualize the base data may be as
    important as the data itself. These layers represent scholarly
    agency and as a result are subject to debate; indeed, as digital
    humanities scholarship matures, such debates are an increasingly
    interesting aspect of the data. Some digital representation systems
    (notably the TEI) already include explicit provision for documenting
    responsibility in a fine-grained manner, and also for representing
    certain kinds of editorial debate and disagreement. These
    affordances are translations or reconceptions of data curation
    practices from the print tradition of the humanities. Digital
    research collections may also represent responsibility and debate in
    ad hoc ways, through annotation or links to other resources that
    offer an alternative view of the data.

[¶ 17](#p008 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

The unique features of curating digital humanities data encompass not
only the data themselves but also the research methods and practices.
Curatorial practices form part of many humanities research
methodologies, and the digital humanities community, in particular,
already possesses sophisticated experience in preserving access to
digital scholarship. Understanding the relationship between critical or
interpretive activities which are also curatorial, and more traditional
curatorial activities, which bear more relation to tasks traditionally
carried out by libraries and archives, will be important in the context
of the humanities. Although digital humanities is comparatively new in
humanities terms, it has developed during a period of extraordinary and
rapid change in all aspects of digital technology: storage technologies,
data formats, hardware design, usage habits, and the emergence of
discipline-specific practices. All of these changes have put tremendous
pressure on the digital humanities community to be attentive to curation
practices, and (perhaps above all) to learn from failure and loss.

[¶ 19](#p009 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

There are a number of activities central to humanities research practice
which themselves inherently curatorial, and whose value is enhanced if
conducted with an awareness of the larger goals of data curation.
Textual editing has for centuries sought to stabilize and transmit an
accurate textual record, with specific enhancements (such as critical
apparatus) which are aimed at making that record more valuable and
tractable for research use. Within the field of textual editing, debates
about method (and experiments with different kinds of apparatus) have
also sensitized scholars to the significance of such choices and the
need for explicit documentation; the critical edition as a result is one
of the best-documented research artifacts in the humanities, and digital
editions typically display this level of meticulous attention as well.
Employing tools from corpus linguistics based on statistical analysis of
textual features, scholarly editors can expand the scope of their
curatorial interventions when working with texts from mass digitization
projects. Similarly, the creation of digital thematic research
collections constitutes an important kind of data curation, inasmuch as
such collections are usually founded on substantial collections of
source materials that have been encoded, annotated, and organized to
maximize their value to researchers. Items in these scholarly research
collections may receive more individual description and
discipline-specific contextualization than libraries, managing large
collections and facing backlogs in basic cataloguing and description,
can provide.

[¶ 20](#p010 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

These activities are directed at creating new knowledge; however,
research practices aimed at interpretation and criticism can be
considered curatorial in nature, particularly if their interpretive
information is brought directly to bear on the material being curated.
Scholarly articles that operate at a distance may offer relevant views
but aren't intended as curatorial gestures, whereas interpretive
annotations or critical interventions that link directly into the data
would constitute very important acts of curation. These more complex
interpretive activities also raise the issue of whether we can represent
and preserve the motivations and debates that underlie them, since these
too may be important for understanding the full semantic field of the
thematic research collection.

research and interactions with large datasets through the lens of two
projects undertaken at Johns Hopkins University. In some ways, this
article represents an early picture of the expansion from eScience to
eResearch. Choudhury and Stinson draw useful comparisons between the
work of astronomers and medievalists in terms of these researchers'
changing relationship to datasets. Even if the specific vision of online
spaces for virtual collaboration has not been realized, this article
remains an accessible introduction to disciplinary data practices and
how they might converge. [full citation ±] Sayeed Choudhury and Timothy
