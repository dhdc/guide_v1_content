## Submission guidelines

We're happy to see that you're interested in contributing to the Guide!

Your voice is a welcome addition. We are glad to review and publish your
contribution, whether it's a pointer to another resource you found
helpful, a paragraph about a preservation strategy you've used, or an
in-depth section enumerating metadata curation issues. Your content
submissions will aid other practicing and aspiring data curators and
digital humanists.

### Editing and licensing

All submissions will be reviewed and responded to in a timely manner by
a managing editor. Contributions are published under a [Creative Commons
Non-Commercial
Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) license,
with the goal of encouraging broad reuse that is in the educational and
community-building spirit of the original publication. (See [licensing
notes](../about/#licensing).) Your submission will be credited to the
name you provide in the submission form. At this time, the names will be
text-only (no links).

### Writing style

The DH Curation Guide is intended first as a community resource, and
second (but importantly) as a curricular resource. Keep your writing
clear and direct. The goal of the Guide is to provide readers with
practices and resources that may assist them in doing a better job of
data curation or in teaching data curation to others. Terms and acronyms
that might be unfamiliar to someone new to the field should be explained
in the text, or else provided with a definition and a note to include
the term in the [glossary](../glossary.html).
