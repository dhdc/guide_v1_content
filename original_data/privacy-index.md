# Privacy Policy

### Site statistics

The DH Curation Guide uses Google Analytics to gather aggregate
information about users. The service does not log IP addresses; it does
log network names and location by city. This information is used to
monitor site activity.

Search terms used with the on-site search tool are also logged, but no
personally identifiable information is recorded.

### Commenting

The DH Curation Guide provides you with opportunities to engage with the
editors, other readers, and article material by leaving comments that
are published immediately. We encourage you to join or start the
conversation with your remarks, suggestions, and questions! The Guide
uses the [Janrain Engage](http://www.janrain.com/products/engage)
sign-in service. Through Janrain Engage, users may log in with an
existing account with Google, Yahoo, Twitter, or Facebook. We value
fruitful discussion on the site, and logging in with an established
online identity supports an honest and civil discussion forum. When you
log in with Janrain Engage, the Guide collects only your username. We do
not collect your password or email address. At this time, only the
username or given name appears on the comment; no link to accounts or
profiles is provided, nor is the chosen sign-in service displayed. We
only use your username information as comment attribution.

Comments remain your intellectual property. When you leave a comment,
you give the DH Curation Guide permission to use and display your
comment in future versions of the Guide as we see fit, and to preserve
the comment in our database as a contribution to Guide content. Be aware
that any personal information you disclose is public and can be seen,
read, and collected by other people or web crawlers.

If you have any concerns or questions, please email the managing editors
at
[hdc-bestpractices@support.lis.illinois.edu](mailto:hdc-bestpractices@support.lis.illinois.edu).

### Submissions

The DH Curation Guide also provides you with opportunities to contribute
standalone material to the Guide in the form of article sections,
paragraphs, or resource citations. We welcome your submissions! These
contributions become part of the Guide’s main body of content, and your
expertise will help others in their data curation practice. We will
gratefully acknowledge your contributions with your name and affiliation
(e.g., "Contributed by John Doe, UCLA"). We will happily link this
citation to your website, bio, or Twitter account at your request.

We will not publish your email address or use it for any reason other
than contacting you about your submission. Please refer to our
[licensing notes](../about/#licensing) for information about our
licensing policy. See our [submission guidelines](../submissions/) for
writing and editing recommendations.

Privacy policy subject to change.
