[Introduction](#legal_policy)

-   [](#) Add introduction comment

Memory institutions have a long history of curation: collecting,
preserving, sharing, describing, and interpreting all kinds of tangible
material. To address the legal issues for digital curation projects, it
is important to start with the “big picture” questions: what does
digital curation in the humanities mean for our collective duty as
stewards of memory? How is digital curation in the humanities a
fundamental concern for new invention, ideas, and expression? Asking and
answering the big questions help shape the way legal issues are
addressed in the context of humanities projects. Collecting digital
creative or original works prompts concerns about a wide range of
possible legal issues – copyright, contract, privacy to name but a few.
These legal responsibilities are significant but should be considered in
the larger context of the socially-valuable stewardship responsibilities
libraries, archives, and museums engage in or new ways of teaching and
approaching education.

Where to begin? Start with core principles and encourage decision makers
to learn to spot the legal issues, address them in written policy and
practice, and rely on the growing body of standards as appropriate to
your effort. Is anyone harmed? What is lost if we fail to act? How is
our role different from the private sector? How can we collaborate
across funding opportunities (whether public, private, or philanthropic)
to meet the potential of digital curation in the humanities? Different
approaches to legal issues may be needed for different kinds of
projects. Are you scanning special collections of distinct analog
materials (books, sound recordings, artwork)? - or collecting and
preserving digital-only web-based material? – or setting up preservation
and emulation collections for digital video games? High-level
principles, policies, and standards can help you develop responsible,
productive projects even for very different kinds of materials or
collections.

[Planning Questions and Issue Spotting](#planning_questions)

-   [](#) Add section comment

When people think about legal issues, they commonly think of contracts,
copyright, privacy and similar concerns. However much of the information
with legal significance is also to be found in written policies for your
organization. It may be legally significant for your project to have
written practices and procedures for your specific project. Such
documents can be as simple or complex as the situation warrants. They
provide a framework for consistency that helps with project management
and orientation for staff working on the project. It is worth investing
in these kinds of documents and revising them as needed, tracking
version dates. Policies and procedures are important for good
communication and keeping projects and people focused on a given goal.
Further, they are important legal evidence – knowing these kinds of
records are in place helps minimize legal exposure and helps minimize
that exposure if questions do arise. This is why there is an emphasis on
guides, standards, and planning in the Resource section. Community
standard and practice and the specific policy and procedure associated
with a project are important as a functional matter as well as a legal
concern.

The following questions are meant to help project managers plan and
recognize some of the matters that should be addressed – this list is by
no means comprehensive. (This list is influenced by the Digital
Preservation Workshop led by Nancy McGovern and Kari Smith:
[http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/dpm/workshops/instructors.html](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/dpm/workshops/instructors.html).)

#### Content in the information ecosystem

-   Did you create it? Can you share it?
-   Did you consider [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) and
    open licenses generally as tools for communicating your intentions
    with regard to your own work?
-   If you did not create it, is there a copyright holder? Do you need
    permission to copy the work?
-   What level of access will you provide?
-   How will you document all of the known legal characteristics in
    metadata?
-   Are you licensing materials or software? How do the terms of the
    licenses affect long-term usability?
-   Did you get information when possible from creators of content e.g.
    copyright, privacy, donor restrictions?

[¶ 5](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Collecting or depositing in an archive or digital repository

-   Do you have the legal right to collect, preserve, and or provide
    access or use the materials?
-   Are there any copyright concerns in the material being collected or
    deposited? What are they and how are they documented?
-   Are there privacy concerns related to the material being collected?
-   Have you looked at examples of submission agreements – will you use
    a model or tailor it to your project? (See Resources for agreements
    in the TAPER project, ICPSR, Data-PASS, MetaArchive, Deep Blue (UM),
    HathiTrust.)

[¶ 6](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Governance

-   Who is in charge? Who is the lead? Who are the parties?
-   Is there a steering committee, an operations committee – how are
    they composed?
-   Who are the authorized representatives for all roles, approvals for
    replacements; how will you communicate and document these matters?
-   How will new members be handled?
-   What rights to members have to contribute data? Do they retain any
    copyright or intellectual property rights? Do they have information
    about copyright, privacy, or other rights and is it included in
    metadata or some other manner?
-   How can members withdraw or be removed? If this is necessary, will
    their contributions remain with the corpus of the collection? Will
    they have access to their contributions after their membership ends?
-   How will disputes be handled?
-   How will changes to agreements be handled (in writing)?

[¶ 7](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Copyright

-   Is the content your creation or someone else’s?
-   Is there any impetus to secure the resulting collection or body of
    material or can it be shared and remixed?
-   Do any of the exceptions to copyright apply? — [Section
    107](http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107), Fair Use;
    [Section 108](http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#108),
    Exceptions for Libraries and Archives; [Section
    110](http://copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110), TEACH Act.
-   Even if there are no copyright concerns, there may be other legal,
    ethical, or practice reasons for managing collections and access to
    collections.

[¶ 8](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Privacy and Human Subjects

-   Are there any privacy or confidentiality requirements such as
    medical, financial, or other personal information included in the
    material?
-   How will private information be protected? Should you collect it at
    all – if so can you manage the security and access control needed?

[¶ 9](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Access and Security

-   Are there qualifications or requirements for users of the collected
    materials or “terms of use”?
-   Who will have access to the materials online? Who will have access
    to the servers/storage?
-   What security restrictions will be needed, over and above the normal
    security for a data installation?
-   Did you get information for the desired level of access in terms of
    duration (short, mid, or long term); who will have access?
-   How will you control the material to conform with any rights you
    have cleared, ensure metadata is accurate over time?
-   Have you addressed accountability in terms of responsibilities and
    documentation? Do you need to plan for audits for financial matters,
    security or other areas of concern? Will you do periodic self-audits
    or self reviews?
-   How will you deal with risk of loss as a legal matter, as a
    financial matter, and as a technical or practical matter (e.g.
    redundant backups)?

[¶ 10](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Derivative research

-   How will derivative research be managed?
-   How will derivative research be made available to others inside and
    outside your organization?
-   How will publication of derivative research be managed legally and
    logistically?
-   How will the “remixed” data be maintained with regard to changes
    made to source data in a digital repository or collection?

[¶ 11](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Policy considerations

-   Are policies and procedures in writing, publicly available where
    appropriate?
-   Are there multiple participants? If so, responsibilities should be
    stated explicitly in agreements with and among the participants.
-   Are policies and procedures reviewed on an ongoing basis to confirm
    they are accurate, being followed, and to consider needed updates?
-   Are there policies and procedures addressing copying, need for
    redundant data, authentication systems, firewalls, backup, and
    disaster preparedness, staff training?

[¶ 12](# "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

#### Additional Considerations

-   Is your project consistent with your organization’s policies and
    procedures?
-   Is your project documented in a way to ensure transparency? Is
    transparency appropriate in some areas e.g. privacy, security
    matters? Can you distinguish these?
-   Are there opportunities for open design and if so what are the
    implications for practical policy and procedure?

[University of Michigan Library: A Case Study](#u_mich)

-   [](#) Add section comment

The environment at the University of Michigan Library of is one of
“policy in action” in support of the campus, research and scholarship
generally. The culture is proactive with attention to both opportunities
and challenges. There is high value placed on collaboration,
cooperation, and shared responsibilities. Many projects are related by
an overall culture of creative thinking and possibility combined with
nuts and bolts pragmatism (“how” do we do it?). This culture is further
supported by vital help from the University’s office of general counsel,
which is able and willing to think creatively with the Library to find
ways to address new and evolving legal scenarios in a manner consistent
with their overarching duty to the University as a whole. In this
environment, seemingly distinct projects and services are thematically
or functionally related because of this institutional culture.

[¶ 14](#p06 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

Deep Blue is the University of Michigan's institutional repository
service. To participate in Deep Blue, authors (as the creators and
copyright holders of their work) must enter an agreement. These standard
agreements and the intellectual property policy that governs the service
are easily accessed at the Deep Blue website. (See Resources.) The
agreements are very simple and straightforward. They are significant
because they only require authors to grant permission to the repository
for us to do necessary tasks – no transfer of copyright is required or
needed. Authors provide a simple non-exclusive grant to the repository
to “display and distribute the submission including its abstract and
descriptive information in electronic format in accordance with the
Repository's policies, copy, convert or migrate the submission to any
medium or format for the purpose of preservation and access, keep more
than one copy of the submission for purposes of security, back-up, and
preservation.” Deep Blue’s approach to author agreements reflects the
need for permanence and consistency as well as a commitment to open
access to the scholarly work product of the University.

[¶ 15](#p07 "Permalink")

The HathiTrust is another manifestation of this commitment to
preservation and access. HathiTrust presents more possible permutations
than Deep Blue regarding agreements and copyright. As a partnership of
major research institutions and libraries, the HathiTrust works to
preserve the cultural record and ensure that it is available in the
future. The HathiTrust’s website reflects overarching policy and culture
as an informative, transparent, living record of its policy and
governance documents which facilitate collaboration among partner
institutions .

[¶ 16](#p08 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

HathiTrust preserves works as, for example, a book as an artifact and as
a cohesive object to be read– but also makes it possible to treat the
same content as data. This in turn allows for non-consumptive research.
Non-consumptive research allows researchers to use “computational
analysis of one or more books without the researcher having the ability
to reassemble the collection. Rather than reading the material,
researchers use specialized algorithms to analyze text as a massive data
set…” The Sloan Foundation is funding a research project by Indiana
University's Data To Insight Center (D2I) on non-consumptive research
with HathiTrust as a large mass digitized collection. D2I is partnering
with the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) and the University of
Michigan's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science on
the project. This kind of research opens new possibilities for
scholarship and discovery.

[¶ 17](#p09 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

For books “as books”, the HathiTrust provides full public access to read
works in the public domain — and for books that for which permission is
obtained from the copyright holder to share publicly. (We provide
Creative Commons options available for interested copyright holders.)
For the public domain determination, we use conservative cutoff - 1923
for US works, 1870 for non-US works. But there are many works beyond
that category that are likely in the public domain.

[¶ 18](#p10 "Permalink")

-   [](#) Add paragraph comment

To research more with more depth and identify books that may be in the
public domain, the [IMLS](../../glossary.html#imls) generously funded
the [Copyright Review Management
System](http://www.lib.umich.edu/imls-national-leadership-grant-crms)
(CRMS). In CRMS, the University of Michigan Library partnered with other
research libraries to ascertain the copyright status of works published
in the US between 1923 and 1963. In that time frame, there were
formalities that were required to maintain a copyright in the US;
failure to do so meant a work entered the public domain. The analysis is
complex, so conservative cutoff dates are typically efficient. However,
by developing a transparent, documented process executed in
collaboration with other libraries, every day brings new information
about the copyright status of books. Reviewers trained in the process
examine works in the HathiTrust – their access is secured and limited to
the review process because of the need to protect scans of books that
are subject to copyright. In thinking about how legal status (and thus
metadata) changes, there is a more complex sequence for providing access
and for determining the rights status of works in HathiTrust than, for
example, Deep Blue. The IMLS will provide another grant to the Library
(the initial grant period concludes November 2011). The new grant allows
us to work with a large number of partner institutions to continue our
revies of books published in the US from 1923 to 1963 and to develop a
process for learning more about the copyright status of books published
in the UK, Canada, Australia and Spain. These grants are opportunities
to think further about legal mechanisms to ensure access and thus
relevance for books in our collections. Copyright-related information is
an invaluable component to thinking about how we can improve and
innovate.

[¶ 19](#p11 "Permalink")

These examples demonstrate the way different perspectives and roles can
be fluid and influence each other. A general observation: experience
with analog collections offer lessons for ways to approach the
multidimensional issues of digital curation and associated legal issues.
For example, the context of a collection of analog material may covey
meaning as a body of material. Further, there may be significance in
each of the items that make up the collection and further significance
in how those things those things were made as well as the materials they
are made from. All of these considerations exist in the realm of digital
curation, making for even more multidimensional research opportunity as
well as growing complexity. Each of those perspectives may have
different legal implications. Get comfortable thinking about your work
as continuous problem solving because there are rarely clear or
definitive answers; and if there are, they will change over time.
Institutional and professional culture as well as overarching policy are
key aspects of working through legal questions.

Remember that copyright status changes over time, making it a real
challenge. When you can get intake agreements directly from creators
that allow you to preserve and use over time, you ease the circulation
of material subject to copyright. Agreements to ingest content – like
those used for Deep Blue – obtain from the author the rights needed for
repository preservation and access while leaving the author with their
copyright. The field of copyright is so large and nuanced that I am only
providing a few resources here – there are many other comprehensive
copyright guides. You should be familiar with basic copyright principles
including exceptions under US law. There is active discussion through
IFLA and other library groups regarding copyright on a global scale and
its intersection with digital collections of all sorts. There are no
absolute solutions. It is important to be comfortable with
indefiniteness in this arena and critical to act in the letter and
spirit of the law. Given this indefiniteness, your written policies and
community practices are legally significant.

-   [](#) Add section comment

Think about privacy concerns associated with the content being collected
– medical or financial information are flags. These should be identified
prior to collecting and on an ongoing basis. It may need to be
documented in written agreements with subjects. Can information be
depersonalized? Consider necessary substantive administrative metadata
and how to handle them as private information.

Excellent overview of complex subject. Universities have their own
“IRBs”; contact yours if you plan any human subject research. Oral
histories and similar research like ethnography typically is excepted
from this kind of review as they are generally distinct from the kind of
research IRBs were designed to address (like biomedical research). Every
university interprets these a bit differently. [full citation ±]

[§ 6](#agreements)

[Agreements](#agreements)

-   [](#) Add section comment

Contracts are legally enforceable promises to do or not do something
based on some reliance and/or exchange. A license, a memorandum of
understanding, and agreement – all of these may be legally binding
contracts regardless of what they are called. Approach contracts as an
opportunity for communication, which may lessen the risk or need for
legal action (or the need to respond to legal action) once your project
is underway. Agreements may be needed between you and other
organizations that are collecting or contributing to the body of
material, licenses for software to support the whole, intake agreements
and more. Some general comments on contracts: state what each party is
expected to do and reference any relevant procedures or practice
standards. They should address duties, how warranties will be made,
indemnifications if any (that is, what happens if the party making the
promise fails to meet its duties or breaches), how that will be funded
(insurance requirements). Sometimes contracts are silent about certain
issues depending on the nature of what is at stake, whether it could be
cured, and the nature of the legal entities who are party to the
contract – but that should be a conscious choice not an oversight. Think
about how agreements can help address rights or duties from the moment
of creation of the content as well as through a lifecycle.

In the digital realm, content is data. You can look at an object in many
ways – as the whole, as the sum of its parts. It quickly becomes rather
metaphysical. The sciences provide many resources for scholars and
project managers useful for digital curation in the humanities because
scientists are accustomed to thinking about data. In the humanities, one
needs to think about the same material from multiple perspectives.

[Open Ideas, Open Access](#open-access)

-   [](#) Add section comment

Ideas associated with open access and tools like Creative Commons
licenses may help shape the way you approach projects. Applying these
concepts in different arena may help with interoperability, access,
long-term preservation to name a few areas. As a legal matter, “open”
are more fluid and easier to administer. Open access policies
functionally remove copyright concerns, easing transactional costs and
expanding opportunity in situations where sharing is desired by the
copyright holder (typically the author) That said, one needs to also
keep in mind privacy responsibilities. You can have content with no
copyright issue that still needs careful management or access limits for
privacy reasons. Its important to keep these different strands in mind
and distinct from one another. Resources are provided as background
reading.

From the abstract: “Articles published as an immediate OA article on the
journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly
accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal
that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more
immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published
in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating
dissemination and uptake of research findings.” [full citation ±] G.

through author payment. This article discusses a few of the favorable
and unfavorable issues and proposes an approach that takes advantage of
the favorable aspects and overcomes some of the unfavorable ones. It
requires extensive government support, which may or may not be feasible,
but the approach is presented here nevertheless. Some evidence is given
for the potential savings that would be achieved by scientists,
publishers and libraries in the US.” [full citation ±] Donald W. King.
